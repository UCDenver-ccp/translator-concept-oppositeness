# translator-concept-oppositeness

This is a sub-project of the text mining project for TRANSLATOR. The current anticipated use cases are (1) lexicon development for text mining applications, and (2) ontology maintenance via addition of opposites and an opposite-of relation. We will be specifying use cases with other TRANSLATOR groups around January 2021.
