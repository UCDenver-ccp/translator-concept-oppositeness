"Paired annotations" files are results of a very early informal experiment in which biologists and non-biologists looked at a short list of words and labelled them as Y(es, these are opposites) or N(o, these are not opposites.

"Opposites annotation" files are from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Turkers were presented with pairs of words that are opposites, and others that are not. Training pairs included actual lexical opposites and actual derivational opposites, as well as repeated words (same word twice), unrelated words (e.g. "bear" and "fig"), and words paired with nonsense words (e.g. "under" and "der"). The opposites include common vocabular (good, bad) and specialized vocabulary (benign, malignant).
