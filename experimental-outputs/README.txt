"Paired annotations" files are results of a very early informal experiment in which biologists and non-biologists looked at a short list of words and labelled them as Y(es, these are opposites) or N(o, these are not opposites.

"Opposites annotation" files are from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Turkers were presented with pairs of words that are opposites, and others that are not. Training pairs included actual lexical opposites and actual derivational opposites, as well as repeated words (same word twice), unrelated words (e.g. "bear" and "fig"), and words paired with nonsense words (e.g. "under" and "der"). The opposites include common vocabular (good, bad) and specialized vocabulary (benign, malignant). 

File named "Batch name TRANSLATOR Opposites 3" corresponds to input file "Opposites annotation - Second experiment inputs.csv". 19 unique annotators did annotation of 220 items.  Master status required, pay of $0.10 per assignment. It appears that I set the number of assignments such that only 19 annotators did this, which means that they had fewer opportunities to "train" themselves. They ended up with an hourly rate of $3.30 an hour, which is way too low. (See the calculations in the .html document in this directory.) I had the number of assignments set to 1, so I will try changing that to 20--I don't really understand what that does, but hopefully I end up with way fewer annotators doing more tasks each, which should speed them up considerably.
