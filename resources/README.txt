BASIC CONTRAST:

A. Middle is/is not excluded
B. You can or cannot be more than one

1. Complementary: excluded middle. dead/alive
2. Antonym: middle not excluded. cold/warm/hot
3. Relational, so you can be more than one: parent/child

"Antonynms" differ with respect to some attribute (long, short) or change in some attribute (to lengthen, to shorten). They exist on a continuum, and an entity can be neither of them: not being long does not of necessity imply being short. 

Antonyms do not support the inference if not(X), then Y.

Antonyms are found in the file known.opposites.antonyms.english.tsv.

"Complementary" pairs differ with respect to... They are incompatible, thus an entity cannot be both dead and alive.  

Complementary pairs do support the inference if not(X), then Y.

Complementary pairs are found in the file known.opposites.complementary.english.tsv.

"Contraries" differ with respect to some specific relation between them, where that relation must be asymmetric. For example, if the (parent, offspring) relation exists between two entities, then a given entity can only be one of those two *in relation to the other.* Contraries do/do not support the inference...
